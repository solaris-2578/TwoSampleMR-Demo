# Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization with Summary Data

This is a demo to use two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) methods with GWAS summary data to estimate causal effects. The random-effect inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method is employed to estimate the effect of body mass index on coronary heart disease. 

The code demo is under `./R`, and a more detailed report is available in `./report` with slides in `./presentation`.
